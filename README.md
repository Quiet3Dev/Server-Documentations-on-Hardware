# Server Documentations on Hardware

This repository is supposed to be documentation on certain components of how data communications go through USB, PCI Express, and Gigabit Ethernet. Later on, we will add more information about other components that would help networking be faster or more responsive towards accepting packets and queries, depending on how the software operates in the intranet. This included cheaper hardware components when it comes to improving network infrastructure and other options that could improve depending on certain conditions and the software being used. For example, if the software uses PHP, NGINX, Apache, and DBDMS, there could be special hardware that could accelerate; however, it will require an extra PCI Express lane to be used, with the installation of a special driver to activate the hardware for use. Overall, this documentation is just a simple understanding of how to find bottlenecks in the server and where to upgrade infrastructure if you need more information about components and data communications between other devices to see if it could reach the maximum speed.

This list has information for [for now]:

- USB Link Speed and its Multiple Generation Limits
    - USB to Ethernet Adapter link speed limits and type USB generation limits
        - USB overhead issues of never reaching the theoretical limit
- Thunderbolt Link Speed Limits
    - Thunderbolt generation differences limits

----------------------------------------------------------------------

This list still being worked on:

- PCI Express Link Speed Limits
    - PCI Express Lanes (x1 to x16) and Generations (1.0 to 6.0)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Future list of documentation:

- Wi-Fi Standards
- Optical Fiber Standards
- CAT Ethernet Standards on Transfer Speed (Difference in LAN Only)
- Other Technology Standards
